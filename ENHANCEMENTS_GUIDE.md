# India Startup Grant Oracle - Enhancements Guide

## Overview

The India Startup Grant Oracle has been enhanced with 5 key improvements that transform it from a simple directory to an intelligent grant discovery and recommendation system. These enhancements provide high-impact value with minimal complexity.

## üéØ Enhancement 1: Confidence Scoring & Data Lineage

### What It Does
- Calculates confidence scores (0-1) for each grant based on data source quality and completeness
- Tracks data lineage to show how information was obtained and processed
- Provides transparency about data reliability

### How It Works
```python
# Base confidence scores by source type
official_portal (.gov.in): 0.9
government_website: 0.85
news_article: 0.6
blog_post: 0.4
social_media: 0.3

# Modifiers applied
+0.1 for clear deadline
+0.1 for funding amount specified
+0.1 for structured data (API/JSON)
-0.1 for PDF extraction
```

### API Usage
```bash
GET /grants
# Returns grants with confidence scores

GET /grants/grant_id
# Shows detailed data lineage
```

### Database Schema
```sql
data_lineage JSONB  -- Tracks source quality and extraction method
confidence DECIMAL(3,2)  -- Final confidence score
```

## üîç Enhancement 2: Smart Deduplication with Fuzzy Matching

### What It Does
- Detects duplicate grants across multiple sources using fuzzy string matching
- Merges information from multiple sources while preserving the highest quality version
- Eliminates confusion from duplicate listings

### How It Works
```python
# Matching criteria
Title similarity: ‚â•85% (using fuzzywuzzy)
Agency similarity: ‚â•80%
Funding amount: within 20% difference

# Deduplication process
1. Compare all grants pairwise
2. Mark duplicates with original_id reference
3. Merge source URLs from all versions
4. Keep highest confidence version as primary
```

### API Usage
```bash
GET /grants?include_duplicates=false  # Default: excludes duplicates
GET /grants?include_duplicates=true   # Shows all versions
```

### Database Schema
```sql
original_id VARCHAR(50)     -- Points to original if duplicate
is_duplicate BOOLEAN        -- Marks duplicate entries
```

---

## üéØ Enhancement 3: Eligibility Matching Score

### What It Does
- Calculates how well a startup profile matches each grant's requirements
- Provides personalized recommendations instead of generic listings
- Generates actionable advice for improving eligibility

### How It Works
```python
# Scoring weights
Stage alignment: 25%
Sector match: 20%
Location eligibility: 15%
Funding amount fit: 15%
Company age: 10%
Company size: 10%
Special criteria: 5%

# Matching algorithm
1. Compare startup profile to grant requirements
2. Calculate weighted score for each criterion
3. Generate recommendations for improvement
```

### API Usage
```bash
POST /grants/match
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "stage": "early_stage",
  "sectors": ["technology", "fintech"],
  "location": "Karnataka",
  "funding_needed": 50,
  "company_age_years": 2,
  "team_size": 8,
  "dpiit_recognized": true
}

# Returns grants ranked by eligibility score
```

### Database Schema
```sql
eligibility_criteria JSONB  -- Structured eligibility requirements
target_audience JSONB       -- Target company characteristics
```

---

## üìä Enhancement 4: Grant Status Monitoring

### What It Does
- Automatically monitors grant websites to detect status changes
- Identifies when deadlines pass or applications close
- Keeps the database current without manual intervention

### How It Works
```python
# Monitoring checks
1. Deadline validation (date comparison)
2. Website accessibility (HTTP status)
3. Content analysis (keyword detection)
4. Status confidence scoring

# Status indicators
Closed keywords: "closed", "expired", "deadline passed"
Open keywords: "apply now", "accepting applications"
```

### API Usage
```bash
GET /grants/monitor
# Triggers status monitoring for grants needing updates

GET /grants?status=live
# Returns only currently active grants
```

### Database Schema
```sql
last_checked_iso TIMESTAMP      -- Last monitoring check
status_reason VARCHAR(100)      -- Why status changed
```

---

## üîß Enhancement 5: Application Complexity Indicator

### What It Does
- Analyzes application requirements to estimate complexity and effort
- Helps startups prioritize grants based on their capacity
- Provides realistic effort estimates

### How It Works
```python
# Complexity factors (weighted)
Document requirements: 25%
Application stages: 20%
Evaluation process: 20%
Timeline duration: 15%
Eligibility criteria: 10%
Funding amount: 10%

# Complexity levels
Simple: 8 hours (1 day)
Medium: 24 hours (3 days)
Complex: 56 hours (1 week)
Very Complex: 120 hours (2-3 weeks)
```

### API Usage
```bash
GET /grants/complexity
# Returns grants with complexity analysis

GET /grants?complexity=simple
# Filter by complexity level

GET /grants/grant_id?include_analysis=true
# Detailed complexity breakdown
```

### Database Schema
```sql
application_complexity VARCHAR(20)  -- simple|medium|complex|very_complex
```

---

## üöÄ Enhanced API Endpoints

### New Endpoints
- `POST /grants/match` - Personalized grant recommendations
- `GET /grants/complexity` - Application complexity analysis
