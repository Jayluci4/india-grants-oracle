# 🚨 India Grants Oracle - Issues and Fixes Summary

## 🔍 Issues Identified

### 1. **Team State Management Problem**
**Error**: `The team is already running, it cannot run again until it is stopped`

**Root Cause**: 
- The Magentic-One orchestrator was reusing the same team instance across multiple URL processing operations
- Team state wasn't being properly reset between operations
- Multiple async operations were trying to use the same team instance simultaneously

**Impact**: 
- Discovery operations failed after processing the first URL
- System couldn't process multiple government portals in sequence
- Reduced grant discovery coverage

### 2. **DateTime Timezone Handling Issue**
**Error**: `can't subtract offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes`

**Root Cause**:
- Some datetime objects had timezone information (offset-aware)
- Others didn't (offset-naive)
- When comparing them in deadline checking, Python threw this error

**Impact**:
- Deadline checking functionality was broken
- No deadline reminders were sent
- Critical feature for grant management was non-functional

### 3. **Playwright/Web Surfer Cancellation**
**Error**: `asyncio.exceptions.CancelledError` in web surfer operations

**Root Cause**:
- Timeout issues during web scraping
- Resource cleanup problems
- Event loop closure issues on Windows

**Impact**:
- Web scraping operations were interrupted
- Grant discovery from government portals failed
- Reduced data collection reliability

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Fixed Team State Management**
**File**: `src/agents/magentic_one_orchestrator.py`

**Changes**:
- Modified `discover_grants_from_url()` to create fresh team instances for each URL
- Updated `process_pdf_document()` to use fresh teams
- Fixed `validate_and_normalize_grant_data()` to use fresh teams
- Enhanced `daily_discovery_mission()` with better error handling

**Code Example**:
```python
# Before: Reusing same team
async for result in self.team.run_stream(task=task):

# After: Fresh team for each operation
fresh_team = MagenticOneGroupChat(
    [web_surfer, file_surfer, coder, terminal],
    model_client=self.model_client
)
async for result in fresh_team.run_stream(task=task):
```

### 2. **Fixed DateTime Timezone Handling**
**File**: `main.py` (already fixed)

**Changes**:
- Added proper timezone handling in `check_deadlines()` method
- Convert all datetimes to naive format for comparison
- Handle both UTC and local time formats
- Added robust error handling for date parsing

**Code Example**:
```python
# Handle both UTC and local time formats
if deadline_str.endswith('Z'):
    deadline_str = deadline_str.replace('Z', '+00:00')
elif '+' not in deadline_str and 'T' in deadline_str:
    deadline_str = deadline_str + '+00:00'

deadline = datetime.fromisoformat(deadline_str)
# Convert to naive datetime for comparison
if deadline.tzinfo:
    deadline = deadline.replace(tzinfo=None)
```

### 3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
**Changes**:
- Added try-catch blocks around individual URL processing
- Improved logging for debugging
- Added graceful degradation when operations fail
- Better resource cleanup

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Script Created
**File**: `test_fixes.py`

**Tests Include**:
1. **Database Operations Test**: Verify database connectivity and queries
2. **Deadline Check Test**: Verify fixed deadline checking functionality
3. **Magentic-One Orchestrator Test**: Verify team state management fixes

**Run Tests**:
```bash
python test_fixes.py
```

## 📊 Expected Results After Fixes

### ✅ Fixed Functionality
- **Multi-URL Processing**: System can now process multiple government portals sequentially
- **Deadline Checking**: Proper deadline reminders will be sent
- **Error Recovery**: System continues operation even if individual URLs fail
- **Resource Management**: Better cleanup of async resources

### 🔄 Improved Reliability
- **Graceful Degradation**: If one component fails, others continue working
- **Better Logging**: More detailed error messages for debugging
- **State Isolation**: Each operation uses fresh resources to avoid conflicts

## 🚀 How to Run the Fixed System

### 1. **Test the Fixes**
```bash
python test_fixes.py
```

### 2. **Run Discovery Mode**
```bash
python main.py --mode discovery
```

### 3. **Run Full System**
```bash
python main.py --mode full
```

### 4. **Run API Only**
```bash
python main.py --mode api
```

## 📈 Performance Improvements

### Before Fixes
- ❌ Discovery stopped after first URL
- ❌ Deadline checking failed
- ❌ Resource leaks and crashes
- ❌ Poor error handling

### After Fixes
- ✅ Sequential URL processing
- ✅ Working deadline reminders
- ✅ Proper resource cleanup
- ✅ Robust error handling
- ✅ Better system stability

## 🔧 Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for Magentic-One AI agents
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key

# Database (already configured)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://grants:grants@localhost:5432/grantsdb
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Notifications (optional)
SLACK_WEBHOOK=https://hooks.slack.com/services/your-webhook
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Run the test script** to verify all fixes work
2. **Test with real URLs** to ensure discovery works
3. **Monitor logs** for any remaining issues
4. **Deploy to production** once verified

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues after applying these fixes:

1. Check the logs for detailed error messages
2. Run the test script to isolate issues
3. Verify environment variables are set correctly
4. Ensure database is accessible
